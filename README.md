Snowman
=======

[Snowman](http://derevenets.com/) is a native code to C/C++ decompiler, supporting x86, AMD64, and ARM architectures.
You can use it as a [standalone GUI application](src/snowman), a [command-line tool](src/nocode), an [IDA plug-in](src/ida-plugin), a [radare2](https://github.com/radare/radare2-pm/blob/master/db/r2snow) plug-in, an [x64dbg plug-in](https://github.com/x64dbg/snowman), or a [library](src/nc).
Snowman is [free software](doc/licenses.md).

Use
---
Clone the [repository](https://github.com/yegord/snowman), follow the [build instructions](doc/build.md), run the decompiler.
Alternatively, download the [prebuilt packages](http://derevenets.com/), unpack, and run.

Contribute
----------
We are not done yet.
We want better generated code, even more convenient GUI, support for other architectures.
